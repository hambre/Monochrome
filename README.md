# Monochrome
A simple black and white Mythtv theme

Install
-------

Just copy the complete folder into your home directory ~/.mythtv/themes. You can now select the theme from the theme chooser in Mythtv frontend.

The theme was created for Mythtv 0.27 but mostly works with version 0.28 of Mythtv too.
